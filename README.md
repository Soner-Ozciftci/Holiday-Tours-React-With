In this project where I used UseState and Use Effect, I used the holiday site as the api address. The information in this application is the short version. You can see the detailed explanation by clicking "Read more", if you are not interested you can say "I am not interested". I provided them the "Button OnClick" feature.

You can refresh the page with the "Refresh" button.
